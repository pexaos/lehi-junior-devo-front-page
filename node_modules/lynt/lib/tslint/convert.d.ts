 * Converts TSLint's JSON format to Lynt's JSON format.

 * The main reason `eslint` and `tslint` have a `convert` file is to have a
 * unified JSON output â€“ ESLint and TSLint have different JSON outputs by
 * default, so this normalizes the difference.
 *
 * TSLint does not organize errors by file, so there is an extra step done to
 * create an error map of fileName => lintErrors before converting.
 *
 * @param tslintResults The lint results received from running TSLint.
 * @return A modified version of the lint results following the lynt's schema.
